# Modified slob.c
#
# slob.c, by default, implements the first-fit algorithm for 
# memory allocation. This modified slob.c alters the current 
# first-fit algorithm to use the more efficient best-fit algorithm.
#
# Example case:
#
# First-fit algorithm (for example process):
#       memory_claimed: XXX
#       memory_free:    XXX
# Best-fit algorithm (for same example process);
#       memory_claimed: XXX
#       memory_free:    XXX
#
#
# As shown, the best-fit algorithm performs more efficiently 
# for this example. Here, efficiency is a measurement of fragmentation
# and NOT time. Depending on the nature of the system, best-fit may 
# perform much more efficiently or much less efficiently.
